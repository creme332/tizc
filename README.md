java -jar tizc.jar
```

Or, run `src/main/java/com/github/creme332/App.java` in an IDE.

> ðŸ”´ **Known bug**: If a white screen is displayed on startup, minimize the window then maximize it again.

## Code coverage
To generate jacoco report:
```bash
mvn jacoco:prepare-agent test install jacoco:report
```

## Usage
Click on the `Play` button and start typing when you are ready. As soon as you make a mistake, the cursor will stop, and you will have to type the correct letter.
